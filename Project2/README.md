## A multilayer percepitron

This percepitron was implemented using *Tensor Flow* libraries in Python. It is meant to take in input variables *x* and *y* and generate an predict what the output would be based on this function:

![f(x,y)=sin(pi*10*x+10/(1+(y^2)))+ln((x^2)+(y+2))](https://github.com/waynesburger/DataSciPrograms/blob/master/Project2/function.PNG)

The training and testing data was generated with the help of *quickFinder.py*, which implements the above function.
