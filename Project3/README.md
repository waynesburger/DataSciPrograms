## Machine Learning Through Evolution

Here is a program that simulates two strategies of evolution:
- **Fitness Proportion**
- **Tournament**

The program is meant to generate *x*,*y* pairs at random and find which pair will produce the largest output based on this finction:

![f(x,y)=sin(pi*10*x+10/(1+(y^2)))+ln((x^2)+(y+2))](https://github.com/waynesburger/DataSciPrograms/blob/master/Project2/function.PNG)

The results of some sample generations are found in the *results_file* folder
